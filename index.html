# Agenda

1. Introduction

  2. Type Analysis Advantages
  2. Signals -> Values over Time
  2. Abstracting Away Side-Effects
  2. The Elm Architecture
1. Sum-up

# Introduction

### Goals

1. Apply Elm's good ideas to our daily work
2. Promote Elm as a development tool

### Format

Some persuasion followed by an Immediate Action (IA)

---

# The Type Analysis Advantage

### This just in: Static types are in, Dynamic types are out!

- Advantages of Elm's Type System
  + Catch Simple **Errors**
  + **Enforce** Semantic Versioning
  + Banish **Nulls**
- _IA: Flow_

---

# Signals -> Values Over Time

```elm
map : (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b

filter : (a -> Bool) -> a -> Signal a -> Signal a

merge : Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a

foldp : (a -> s -> s) -> s -> Signal a -> Signal s
```

- _Signals_ are **connected to the world**
- _Signals_ are **infinite**
- Signal _graphs_ are **static**
- _Signals_ are **synchronous**

Huh?  You can _not_ delete, create, or unsubscribe from signals at runtime.

---

# Signal Graph

The Signal Graph is like any system of pipes:
(a) source, (b) branches, and (c) sink.

---

# Signal Graph (cont'd)

An Application's signal graph can have multiple sources, branches, and sinks.

Sources:
```elm

```

Branches:

```elm

```
Sinks:
```elm
-- the signal's value (an element) is rendered to screen
main : Signal Element

-- Send strings to JavaScript
port someJavaScriptFn : Signal String

-- Send Tasks to Elm Runtime
```

---

# Abstracting Away Side-Effects

- Tasks
- Effects
- _IA: Promises_

---

# Monads?

> I would be really sad to see the "monad tutorial" meme spreading to Elm. We
> can't keep using the same pedagogy and think it'll come out different the
> N+1 time.
