# What is Elm and Why Should I Care?

# Direct Complaints as Follows

![trash can](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/12/17834156_aa3bc64c96_z.jpg?zz=1)

---

### Goals

1. Apply Elm's good ideas to our daily work
2. Promote Elm as a development tool

### Agenda

1. Introduction to Elm
1. Details of How it Works
  2. Type Analysis Advantages
  2. Signals -> Values over Time
  2. Abstracting Away Side-Effects
1. Sum-up


### Format

Some **persuasion** followed by an _Immediate Action (IA)_

---

# Intro: Syntax

- Haskell-like syntax
- Statically Typed

```elm
import Graphics.Element exposing (..)
import Window

main : Signal Element
main =
  Signal.map resizeablePaint Window.dimensions

resizeablePaint : (Int,Int) -> Element
resizeablePaint (w,h) =
  fittedImage w h "/imgs/paint.jpg"

-- Types can be ommitted/inferred in most cases but are nice for Doc
```

Type Aliases

```elm
type alias Name = String
type alias Age = Int
```

---

# Intro: Tool-chain

Written in Haskell
```bash
elm-make       # Compiles Elm to JS
elm-package    # Package Manager
elm-repl       # A Read-Eval-Print-Loop
elm-reactor    # Quick-start Watcher/Builder
elm            # Wrapper around all the tools
```

---

# The Type Analysis Advantage

### This just in: Dynamic types are out, Static types are in!

- Advantages of Elm's Type System
  + Catch Simple **Errors**
  + Banish **Nulls**
  + **Enforce** Semantic Versioning
- _IA: Flow_

---

# The Simple Errors

Goodbye spelling mistakes and refactoring lapses:

![Elm error messages](http://elm-lang.org/assets/blog/error-messages/0.15.1/naming.png)

---

# Banish Null

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. 
_- Tony Hoare (Builder of Algol W)_

No nulls in Elm, Just Maybes:

```elm
type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

Allows the compiler to enforce "null-checks" when needed.

---

# Enforcing Semantic Versioning

elm-package will bump versions for you, automatically enforcing these rules:

- all packages start with initial version 1.0.0
- Versions are incremented based on how the API changes:
  + PATCH - the API is the same, no risk of breaking code
  + MINOR - values have been added, existing values are unchanged
  + MAJOR - existing values have been changed or removed

Even Rust-lang is talking about adding similar checks: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/signature-based-api-comparison/2377

---


# IA: Flow

.center[flowtype.org]

```javascript
/* @flow */
function foo(x) {
  return x * 10;
}
foo('Hello, world!');  // Error: This type is incompatible with ...: string
```

```javascript
/* @flow */
function foo(x: string, y: number): string {
  return x.length * y;
}
foo('Hello', 42); // Error:  number ... type is incompatible with ... string
```

Babel will strip it out for you:
  [http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-flow-strip-types/](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-flow-strip-types/)

---

# One Beef with Flow

> In JavaScript, null implicitly converts to all the primitive types; it is also a valid inhabitant of any object type.
> 
> In contrast, Flow considers null to be a distinct value that is not part of any other type.

- Let's be Honest: In JavaScript, _all types are nullable_!
- Requires programmer discipline to be honest about which vars are _not_ Maybe (fewer than we think)
- Not a great decision for a gradually-typed system over a language with nullable types

## Recommendation 
**As a habit in flow, mark things as Maybe**

---

# Signals -> Values Over Time

- Discrete values over time
- Signal Graphs
- _IA: RxJS_

---

# Discrete Values Over Time

```elm
type Signal a
```
> A value that changes over time. Every signal is updated at discrete
> moments in response to events in the world.

---

# Signal Characteristics

- _Signals_ are **connected to the world**
- _Signals_ are **infinite**
- Signal _graphs_ are **static**
- _Signals_ are **synchronous**

Huh?

---

# Signal Characteristics

- _Signals_ are **connected to the world**
- _Signals_ are **infinite**
- Signal _graphs_ are **static**
- _Signals_ are **synchronous**

Infinite & Static: You **cannot** _delete_, _create_, or _unsubscribe_ from signals at runtime.

Synchronous: FIFO

---
# Signal Graph

The Signal Graph is like any system of pipes:
(a) sources, (b) branches, and (c) sinks.

![Elm signal Diagram](http://elm-lang.org/assets/diagrams/signals.png)

---

# Signal Graph (cont'd)

An Application's signal graph can have multiple sources, branches, and sinks.

Sources:
```elm
position : Signal (Int, Int)   -- Mouse
clicks : Signal ()             --

dimensions : Signal (Int, Int) -- Window
```

Branches:
```elm
map : (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b
filter : (a -> Bool) -> a -> Signal a -> Signal a
merge : Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a
foldp : (a -> s -> s) -> s -> Signal a -> Signal s
```

Sinks:
```elm
main : Signal Element                 -- element to be rendered to screen
port someJavaScriptFn : Signal String -- Send strings to JavaScript
```

---

# IA: RxJS

RxJS = Observables + Operators + Schedulers.

1. Represent _asynchronous data streams_ with **Observables** (Sources)
1. _Query_ observables using our many **operators**           (Branches)
1. Parameterize _the concurrency_ in the Observables using **Schedulers**

```javascript
/* Get stock data somehow */
var source = getAsyncStockData();  // Source

var subscription = source
  .filter(function (quote) {       // Branches
    return quote.price > 30;
  })
  .map(function (quote) {
    return quote.price;
  })
  .subscribe(                      // Sink
    function (price) {
      console.log('Prices higher than $30: $' + price);
    },
    function (err) {
      console.log('Something went wrong: ' + err.message);
    });

/* When we're done */
subscription.dispose();
```

---

# Abstracting Away Side-Effects

- Tasks
- Effects
- _IA: Promises_

---

# Tasks

```elm
type Task x a
```

> Represents asynchronous effects that return value of type **a** but _may fail_ with value of type **x**. It is useful for stuff like HTTP.

Sound like Promises?  They are even chainable with `andThen`:

```elm
logCurrentTime : Task x ()
logCurrentTime =
  getCurrentTimeTask `andThen` consoleLogTask
```

---

# Effects

```elm
type Effects a
```

> The Effects type is essentially a data structure holding a bunch of independent tasks that will get run at some later point. 

Example making an HTTP request for jsonData:

```elm
getData : String -> Effects Action
getData url =
  Http.get decodeJsonData url
    |> Task.toMaybe
    |> Task.map NewGif
    |> Effects.task
```

---

# Explained

```elm
getData : String -> Effects Action
getData url =
  Http.get decodeJsonData url
    |> Task.toMaybe
    |> Task.map NewGif
    |> Effects.task
```

- **`Task.toMaybe`** drops the error message and returns a `Maybe String` type.
- **`Task.map NewGif`** wraps the `Maybe String` in a `NewGif` action.
- **`Effects.task`** turn this task into an `Effects` type.

---

# Task, Maybe, Effects Oh My!

Effects wrap Tasks that are guaranteed to "not fail" ... meaning they have an _error handler_.

**`Task.toMaybe`** and **`Task.toResult`** are _convenience functions_ to move errors into
the success handler by returning a new task.

```elm
toMaybe : Task x a -> Task y (Maybe a)
toMaybe task =
  map Just task `onError` (\_ -> succeed Nothing)

toResult : Task x a -> Task y (Result x a)
toResult task =
  map Ok task `onError` (\msg -> succeed (Err msg))
```

---

# Why are Effects useful?

Thoughts?

---

# Why are Effects useful?

My theory:  to make the `start-app` package better!

If you can collect the tasks for all your components that will be rendered,
you can run them in a batch _but only if they **never fail**_.

# Monads?

> I would be really sad to see the "monad tutorial" meme spreading to Elm. We
> can't keep using the same pedagogy and think it'll come out different the
> N+1 time.
_- Evan Czaplicki_

[http://elm-discuss.narkive.com/6gJ7aPMj/monads-in-elm-tutorial](http://elm-discuss.narkive.com/6gJ7aPMj/monads-in-elm-tutorial)

---

# Monads?

**Gauche** = _socially awkward_

---

# IA: Promises

```javascript
var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // something async happens
});

p.then(successHandlerFn, failureHandlerFn);
```

What can we learn from Elm?

**Don't reject promises needlessly**

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  doAsync((err, result) => {
    if (err) return resolve({status: 'failed', data: err})
    resolve({status: 'success', data: result})
  })
});
```

---

# Sum-up

- Try out Elm
- Or:
  + Use flow for static type analysis
  + Use RxJS for FRP goodness
  + Use Promises that "never fail"

More realistically, use some combination of the above ;)
