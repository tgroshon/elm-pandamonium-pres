### Goals

1. Apply Elm's good ideas to our daily work
2. Promote Elm as a development tool

### Agenda

1. Introduction to Elm
1. Details of How it Works
  2. Type Analysis Advantages
  2. Signals -> Values over Time
  2. Abstracting Away Side-Effects
1. Sum-up


### Format

Some **persuasion** followed by an _Immediate Action (IA)_

---

# Intro: Syntax

- Haskell-like syntax
- Statically Typed
- Declarative
- Compile-to-JavaScript

```elm
import Graphics.Element exposing (..)
import Window

main : Signal Element
main =
  Signal.map resizeablePaint Window.dimensions

resizeablePaint : (Int,Int) -> Element
resizeablePaint (w,h) =
  fittedImage w h "/imgs/paint.jpg"

-- Types can be ommitted/inferred in most cases but are nice for Doc
```

Type Aliases

```elm
type alias Name = String
type alias Age = Int
```

---

# Intro: Tool-chain

Written in Haskell
```bash
elm-make       # Compiles Elm to JS
elm-package    # Package Manager
elm-repl       # A Read-Eval-Print-Loop
elm-reactor    # Quick-start Watcher/Builder
elm            # Wrapper around all the tools
```

## Other tools

- Webpack Loader: _https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-webpack-loader_
- `elm-make` JS Bindings: _https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-elm-compiler_

---

# The Type Analysis Advantage

### This just in: Dynamic types are out, Static types are in!

- Advantages of Elm's Type System
  + Catch Simple **Errors**
  + Banish **Nulls**
  + **Enforce** Semantic Versioning
- _IA: Flow_

---

# The Simple Errors

Goodbye spelling mistakes and refactoring lapses:

![Elm error messages](http://elm-lang.org/assets/blog/error-messages/0.15.1/naming.png)

---

# Banish Null

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. 
_- Tony Hoare (Builder of Algol W)_

No nulls in Elm, Just Maybes:

```elm
type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

Allows the compiler to enforce "null-checks" when needed.

---

# Enforcing Semantic Versioning

elm-package will bump versions for you, automatically enforcing these rules:

- all packages start with initial version 1.0.0
- Versions are incremented based on how the API changes:
  + PATCH - the API is the same, no risk of breaking code
  + MINOR - values have been added, existing values are unchanged
  + MAJOR - existing values have been changed or removed

Even Rust-lang is talking about adding similar checks: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/signature-based-api-comparison/2377

---


# IA: Flow

.center[flowtype.org]

```javascript
/* @flow */
function foo(x) {
  return x * 10;
}
foo('Hello, world!');  // Error: This type is incompatible with ...: string
```

```javascript
/* @flow */
function foo(x: string, y: number): string {
  return x.length * y;
}
foo('Hello', 42); // Error:  number ... type is incompatible with ... string
```

Babel will strip it out for you:
  _http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-flow-strip-types/_

---

# One Beef with Flow

> In JavaScript, null implicitly converts to all the primitive types; it is also a valid inhabitant of any object type.
> 
> In contrast, Flow considers null to be a distinct value that is not part of any other type.

- Let's be Honest: In JavaScript, _all types are nullable_!
- Requires programmer discipline to be honest about which vars are _not_ Maybe (fewer than we think)
- Not a great decision for a gradually-typed system over a language with nullable types

## Recommendation 
**As a habit in flow, mark things as Maybe**

---

# Signals -> Values Over Time

- Discrete values over time
- Signal Graphs
- _IA: RxJS, Most.js, Flyd_

---

# Discrete Values Over Time

```elm
type Signal a
```
> A value that changes over time. Every signal is updated at discrete
> moments in response to events in the world.

So like an EventEmitter?  Almost, and not quite.

The **Reactive** in Elm _Functional-Reactive Programming_

---

# Signal Characteristics

- **Synchronous**: FIFO
- **Infinite & Static**: You **cannot** _delete_, _create_, or _unsubscribe_ from signals at runtime.

---

# Signal Graph

Your program ends up being a graph of signals.

Think of pipes (streams):
  (a) sources, (b) branches, and (c) sinks.

![Elm signal Diagram](http://elm-lang.org/assets/diagrams/signals.png)

---

# Signal Graph (cont'd)

An Application's signal graph can have multiple sources, branches, and sinks.

Sources:
```elm
position : Signal (Int, Int)   -- Mouse
clicks : Signal ()             --

dimensions : Signal (Int, Int) -- Window
```

Branches (Transforms):
```elm
map : (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b
filter : (a -> Bool) -> a -> Signal a -> Signal a
merge : Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a
foldp : (a -> s -> s) -> s -> Signal a -> Signal s
```

Sinks:
```elm
main : Signal Element                 -- element to be rendered to screen
port someJavaScriptFn : Signal String -- Send strings to JavaScript
```

---

# But Why Signals?

1. Naturally handles _asynchrony_
1. Naturally model _data over time_ while avoiding shared mutable state

---

# IA: FRP Streams in JS

Contenders:

* RxJS (**Biggest**)
* Bacon.js (_Slowest_)
* Kefir.js (**Middle**)
* Most.js (_Fastest_)
* Flyd (**Smallest**)

I'll discuss _RxJS_, _Most_, and _Flyd_

---

# IA: RxJS

RxJS implements *Observables*

```javascript
/* Get stock data somehow */
var source = getAsyncStockData()    // Source is an observable

source
  .filter(function (quote) {        // Branches
    return quote.price > 30
  })
  .map(function (quote) {
    return quote.price
  })
  .subscribe(function (price) {     // Sink
    console.log('Prices higher ' +
                'than $30: $' +
                price)
  })
```

Most popular but also the largest file size (around **200kb** minified)

Can choose asynchrony between `setImmediate`, `setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame`

---

# IA: Most.js

_Monadic_ Streams

```javascript
most.from([1, 2, 3, 4])
  .delay(1000)
  .filter(function(i) {
    return i % 2 === 0
  })
  .reduce(function(result, y) {
    return result + y
  }, 0)
  .then(function(result) {
    console.log(result)
  })
```
Super fast and around **50kb** minified, uncompressed

Consuming functions (`reduce`, `forEach`, `observe`) return Promises.

---

# IA: Flyd

Pronounced _flu_ (it's Dutch)

```javascript
var x = flyd.stream(10) // Create stream with initial value
var y = flyd.stream(20)

var sum = flyd.combine(function(x, y) {
  return x() + y() // Calling stream without argument returns last value
}, [x, y])

flyd.on(function(s) {
  console.log(s)
}, sum)
```

Very Simple. Modeled after Elm Signals.

Mostly just gives low-level composition constructs e.g. `combine`, `merge`, `transduce`

---

# Abstracting Away Side-Effects

- Tasks
- Effects
- _IA: Promises_

---

# Tasks

```elm
type Task x a
```

> Represents asynchronous effects that return value of type **a** but _may fail_ with value of type **x**.

Sound like Promises?  They are even chainable with `andThen`:

```elm
logCurrentTime : Task x ()
logCurrentTime =
  getCurrentTimeTask `andThen` consoleLogTask
```

---

# Effects

```elm
type Effects a
```

> The Effects type is essentially a data structure holding a bunch of independent tasks that will get run at some later point. 

Example making an HTTP request for jsonData:

```elm
getData : String -> Effects Action
getData url =
  Http.get decodeJsonData url
    |> Task.toMaybe
    |> Task.map NewGif
    |> Effects.task
```

---

# Explained

```elm
type Action = NewGif (Maybe String) | ... -- some other action

getData : String -> Effects Action
getData url =
  Http.get decodeJsonData url
    |> Task.toMaybe
    |> Task.map NewGif
    |> Effects.task
```

- **`Task.toMaybe`** drops the error message and returns a `Maybe String` type.
- **`Task.map NewGif`** wraps the `Maybe String` in a `NewGif` action.
- **`Effects.task`** turn this task into an `Effects` type.

---

# Task, Maybe, Effects Oh My!

Effects wrap Tasks that are guaranteed to "not fail" ... meaning they have an _error handler_.

**`Task.toMaybe`** and **`Task.toResult`** are _convenience functions_ to move errors into
the success handler by returning a new task.

```elm
toMaybe : Task x a -> Task y (Maybe a)
toMaybe task =
  map Just task `onError` (\_ -> succeed Nothing)

toResult : Task x a -> Task y (Result x a)
toResult task =
  map Ok task `onError` (\msg -> succeed (Err msg))
```

---

# Why are Effects useful?

Thoughts?

---

# Why are Effects useful?

My theory:  to make the `start-app` package better!

If you can collect the tasks for all your components that will be rendered,
you can run them in a batch _but only if they **never fail**_.

---

# IA: Promises

```javascript
var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // something async happens
});

p.then(successHandlerFn, failureHandlerFn);
```

What can we learn from Elm?

**Don't reject promises needlessly**

```javascript
var p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  doAsync(function (err, result) {
    if (err) {
      return resolve({status: 'failed', data: err})
    }
    resolve({status: 'success', data: result})
  })
})
```

---

# Sum-up

- Try out Elm
- Or:
  + Use flow for static type analysis
  + Use a JavaScript FRP Library
  + Use Promises that "never fail"

More realistically, use some combination of the above ;)
